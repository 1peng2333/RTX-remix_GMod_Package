### Installion
1. Download this repository by clicking the green "Code" buttom on the top right, and click "Download ZIP"
2. Go to (Whatever drive):\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod <- (Note there will be a "garrys mod" folder inside, don't ever go in there!)
3. **Back up** your game client, a complete copy of the game into another place is recommended (so you can play normal Garry's mod if you felt dizzy with the RTX!).
**Back up****Back up****Back up****pz Back up****PZ Back up!**

4. Drop everything inside "GarrysMod" folder (The one that G is capital and hl2.exe is inside), replace all if noticied.
5. Run any bats file that matches your resolution.
6. (Optional) **Disable all your mods**, enable necessary ones later, use the **default or invisible player model at first**.
7. Load gm_construct RTX version map in your sandbox map browser. Press Alt + X to configure.

### Performance
This package was tested in a few devices listed below, all on "gm_construct_rtx" map, factory settings:
DLSS Balanced, Frame generated enabled if possible.
| Device  | FPS | FPS (1% Low) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 12900K + 2080  | DIED  | WONT RUN |
| 13900K + 3060Ti  | 24  | 9  |
| 13900K + 3080Ti  | 39  | 25  |
| 13900K + 4070 Super  | 57  | 41  |
| 14900K + 4090  | 96  | 59  |
| 7800X3D + 4090  | 111  | 73  |

### Notes
1. A NVIDIA RTX Video card is required, recommended RTX 4070+ or RTX 3090+. RTX 20XX cards won't work. Use RTX 40XX to use DLSS Frame Generation.
2. Newest NVIDIA Driver is Required, NVIDIA Studio driver is recommended.
3. 4k resolution does not perform well, expect crashes.
4. Special thanks to Xenthio (links above) and NVIDIA, this is an edit to their work that ensure everything is working at a point.
5. Does not run on Linux.
6. You can get more RTX-remix map mods for Garry's Mod from ModDB.
