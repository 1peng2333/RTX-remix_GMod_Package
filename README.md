### Installion (Please don't skip or reorder any step)

2. Update your NVIDIA Driver to the newest version available. Restart your computer after the update is finished.
3. Go to (Whatever drive):\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod <- (Note there will be a "garrysmod" folder inside "GarrysMod, don't ever go in there!)
4. **Back up** your game client, a complete copy of the game into another place is recommended (so you can play normal Garry's mod if you felt dizzy with the RTX!).
**Back up**, **Back up**, **Back up**, **pz Back up**, **PZ Back up!**
5. **Disable all your mods** in vallina Garry's mod, enable necessary ones later, use the **default or invisible player model at first**.
6. **Did you backup?** Uninstall Garry's Mod in Steam (Yes, that is why we need to back up)
7. Delete this folder: (Whatever drive):\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod (For clean installation, make sure all files within that folder is deleted)
8. Download Garry's Mod again on Steam. If you feel slow, you could also unsub all workshop addons.
9. Drop everything of the **Release** zip file into "GarrysMod" folder (The one that G is capital and hl2.exe or gmod.exe is inside), replace all if notified.
10. Rename the folder "GarrysMod" into "GarrysMod_RTX". (To stop the game from updating).
11. Move your backup back to (Whatever drive):\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common, rename the folder containing your game backup to "GarrysMod", so you can play still vailina Garry's Mod through Steam.
12. Run any bats file that matches your resolution. The bat files are located at (Whatever drive):\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod_RTX\
13. Load gm_oldpoolday (recommended) or gm_construct RTX (legacy) version map in your sandbox map browser. Press Alt + X to configure RTX-Remix.

| 14900K + 2080 | DIED | WONT RUN | 2 |

### Notes
1. A NVIDIA RTX Video card is required, recommended RTX 4070+ or RTX 3090+. RTX 20XX cards won't work. Use RTX 40XX to use DLSS Frame Generation.
2. The game is at an older version, which will prevent you from joining any servers running newer versions. This will dismiss potential risks with VAC.
3. Most recent NVIDIA Driver is Required, NVIDIA Studio driver is recommended.
4. Special thanks to Xenthio (links above) and NVIDIA, this is an edit to their work that ensure everything is working at a point.
5. Does not run on Linux.
6. You can get more RTX-remix map mods for Garry's Mod from ModDB.
